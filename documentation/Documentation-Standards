  <h1>Documents</h1>
  <div class="p">
    A 'document' here refers to a file which may be rendered in a
    readable, human friendly form. Every file in a Conveyor project is
    considered a document. Consequently, the entire runtime stack may
    be read as a series of documents.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    In practice, the document set can be divided between explicit
    documents and runtime artifacts or source
    code.<span class="note">'Source code' typically denotes program
    code, but not necessarily configuration files or other runtime
    artifacts. However, the term 'source code' is potentially broad
    and less clunky, so we prefer it here.</span> Explicit documents
    are "documents and nothing more", while the primary purpose of
    source code is as program input. Conveyor source code should be
    annotated according to
    the <a href="#Source-Code-Conventions">source code
    conventions</a>.

  <h1>Sections and Headers</h1>
  <div class="p">
    Top level sections should be denoted by the
    HTML5 <code>section</code> element and all document content should
    be contained within sections. Every section in a document should
    have a unique <code>id</code> attribute.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    The initial document section may be untitled, especially if it is
    an overview section. All subsequent sections should be titled and
    the title should match the section <code>id</code>.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    Subsections may be explicitly created with
    nested <code>section</code> elements or they may be implied
    through the use of header
    elements, <code>h2</code>, <code>h3</code>, etc. When there is no
    explicit <code>section</code> element, the section <code>id</code>
    should be associated with the header
    element.<span data-perspective="detailed"> The use of explicit
    sections may be usefully employed in conjuction
    with <code>data-perspective</code> attributes.</span> Generally,
    implicit sections should be preferred unless there is a reason for
    declaring an explicit section though it is also somewhat a matter
    of taste and style.
